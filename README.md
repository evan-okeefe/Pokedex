# Data for Social Good Project - Pokédex

## Overview
This project is a functional **Pokédex** developed as part of a school assignment to demonstrate developing programs to work with data and provide information to a user.

## Project Requirements

- **Write a class**:
  - Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
  
- **Create at least two 1D arrays**:
  - Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.

- **Write a method**:
  - Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
  
- **Implement a toString() method**:
  - Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
    
- **Document your code**:
  -  Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Optional Features
- **Incorporate user interaction**:
  - Use methods in the Scanner class to obtain user input to interact with your data analysis program.

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism**:
  - Create classes to represent the types of data with overridden methods and use a 1D array of a superclass type to store the objects.
